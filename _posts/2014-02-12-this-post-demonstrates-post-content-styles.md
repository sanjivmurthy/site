excerpt:  This is a Data Science research competition finishing in the top 15\% of 832 teams in model accuracy.

I generated visualizations, did feature engineering, modeled with sklearn data pipelines to create the model. <ul class="actions"> <li><a href="https://github.com/sanjivmurthy/TaxiRidePrediction" class="button">View</a></li> </ul>
