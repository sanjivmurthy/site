excerpt: Today, market sentiment analysis is used widely by trading algorithms to pick the right stocks to buy. This project tracks price and sentiment by the minute on 5 different cryptocurrencies and stocks. Price data gets fetched by the Alpha Vantage API and is displayed by Dash. Tweets get streamed through tweepy API and are stored in a SQLite database. Sentiment analysis determines whether the tweet contains a positive or negative message about the company. Twitter engagement is displayed on Dash. The project is written in Python and hosted on Heroku.
